## Presentation 
MIF (My International Friends) is an app built in RoR (Ruby on Rails), as a final project for [THP](https://www.thehackingproject.org/).
We created in 2 weeks an app where people can begin conversation with someone in an other country, and the point is that the two of them will invite each other.
You will be able to find people by cities but also with a matchmaking algorithm to have the best chances to find the right person to enjoy your trip as much as you can.
You not sure that you will find something to say to your next best friend ?
No worries we also have a little game for breaking the ice between you, now you have became friend check the disponibility of each other on our scheduler and go create incredible memories!!
